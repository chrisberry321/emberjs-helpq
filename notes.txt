Services are objects that live throughout the span of an Ember application.

Services are singletons. 

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

An Ember.Service is nothing more than an Ember.object. the name service is used a convention. If services are placed in a specific Ember CLI folder (app/services) they will be automatically registered and available for injection in any other Ember object.

these service objects can:
1. keep state around for the duration of an app (state won't survive page reloads)
2. be used from anywhere in the application


a session needs to be injected into the controller/router/component in order for the session service to accessible to that item.
